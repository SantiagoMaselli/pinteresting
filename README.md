This is the pinteresting sample application for
[*One Month Rails*](http://onemonthrails.com)

by [Santiago Maselli](http://maquinadeaplausos.com)

This project will be used to learn so later I will have the necessary skills to create something better and bigger, something which I have not yet defined.

After creating the pinteresting app, I would like to create an app where you choose which products to add to a basket. Also, you will be able to choose what type of basket, color and the decoration you like the most. 

I would like to use the app in this [*website*](http://dulcecacatua.com)
